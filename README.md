# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Tweeter allows you to post tweets. It will generate an error message if you try to compose a tweet too long or empty. The character counter and time posted are fully functional. The layout will also adjust for tablets and movile when shrunk below 1024 wide. Please feel free to navigate/ play on the site.

This is the second application I have ever made! Here, I learned a lot about CSS/ HTML but hopefully my future applications will look even better. More to come!
